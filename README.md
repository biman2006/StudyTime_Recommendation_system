# StudyTime_Recommendation_system 📚
This is a Machine Learning Model that recommends how many time should study for a student based on several features.


## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that recommends appropriate study time for students based on various academic and personal performance factors.
The goal is to help students improve their academic outcomes by understanding how study time influences performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information related to students’ academic performance and habits, such as:
Study time
Attendance
Previous scores
Other performance-related factors
These features are used to analyze patterns and train the model.
Objective
To analyze the relationship between study time and student performance
To build a machine learning model that can recommend an optimal study time
To gain practical experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

## Approach

1. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values
Feature selection
Data normalization (if required)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding trends and correlations
Visualizing the impact of study time on performance

3. Model Building
Implemented a machine learning regression model
Trained the model on the dataset to predict performance or recommend study time

4. Evaluation
Compared predicted results with actual values
Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

5. Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

## Results
The model successfully learns patterns from the data and provides reasonable study time recommendations based on student-related factors.
This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in the education domain.

## Conclusion
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of machine learning workflows, from data analysis to model evaluation, while solving a real-world educational problem.
